# Render the preview

When creating the editor you have to set up a `preview` attribute with an endpoint that will be called using the POST method to render the initial preview and every block on change

## Render the initial preview

The first call will contain all the component data in a JSON array.

```bash
curl 'https://preview/' \
  --data-raw $'[<BLOC_DATA>]' \
  --compressed
```

The server must return an HTML document with these specifics requirements :

- An element with an id "ve-components" must be present
- A `<div>` must be used to wrap every page component and must be direct children of `#ve-components`

Here is an example

```html
<!DOCTYPE>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Title</title>
  <!-- -->
</head>
<body>
  <header>Header</header>
  <div id="ve-components">
    <div class="container">
      First block
    </div>
    <div class="container py-5">
      Second block
    </div>
    <div class="container py-2 bg-primary">
      Third block
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Render an update

When updating a field the same endpoint will be called with the component data and an extra "preview" property set to true.

```bash
curl 'https://visual-editor.droapp.com/' \
  --data-raw $'{"title":"Album example","_name":"hero","_id":"0","preview":true}' \
  --compressed
```

The server must return the HTML code of the component (without any extra HTML around)

```html
<div class="container">
  The new component
</div>
```
